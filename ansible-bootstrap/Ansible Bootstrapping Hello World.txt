Ansible Bootstrapping Hello World

Learn how to connect form Ansible hosts to target systems

# Intro Text

In this tutorial, we will learn, how to prepare a target system, so an Ansible system can connect to it.

# Environment Customization

mkdir shared_volume
docker pull williamyeh/ansible:ubuntu14.04-onbuild
docker network create mynetwork
cd shared_volume
docker run -d --name ansible --rm --network mynetwork -v $(pwd):/shared_volume williamyeh/ansible:ubuntu14.04-onbuild /bin/bash -c 'while true; do sleep 60; echo keepalive; done'
docker run -d --name target --rm --network mynetwork -v $(pwd):/shared_volume ubuntu:14.04 /bin/bash -c 'apt-get update; apt-get install -y openssh-server;service ssh start; while true; do sleep 60; echo keepalive; done'
A() { docker exec -i ansible $*; }
T() { docker exec -i target $*; }
a() { docker exec -it ansible bash; }
t() { docker exec -it target bash; }
a() { docker exec -it ansible bash -c "echo 'PS1='\''ansible# '\' >> /root/.bashrc; bash"; }
sleep 30

# 1. Prepare Environment for easier Toggling between Ansible and Target System

To make our lives easier later, let us define the commands "a" and "t" for quickly connecting from the base system to the ansible and target container: 

Connect to the Ansible container:

```a() { docker exec -it ansible bash -c "echo 'PS1='\''ansible# '\' >> /root/.bashrc; bash"; } ```{{execute HOST1}} 

Connect to the Target container:

```
t() {  docker exec -it target bash -c "echo 'PS1='\''target# '\' >> /root/.bashrc; bash";  } ```{{execute HOST1}} 

In this tutorial, we already have started an ansible and a target container in the background. However, they have been started in the background, and they need some time to become available. Repeat using a docker ps command to check, whether Docker containers named 'ansible' and 'target' have been started already:

`docker ps`{{execute HOST1}}

Repeat sending the command until it looks similar to 
<pre>
CONTAINER ID      IMAGE                                   COMMAND                 CREATED         STATUS
            PORTS NAMES
c96e3a45e164      ubuntu:14.04                            "/bin/bash -c 'whi..."  11 seconds ago  Up 9 seconds target
caf61a258abb      williamyeh/ansible:ubuntu14.04-onbuild  "/bin/bash -c 'whi..."  13 seconds ago  Up 11 seconds ansible
</pre>

# 2. Verify Ansible installation

# Check Ansible Version

As soon as the ansible container are seen in the docker ps command, we should be able to connect to the Ansible container using our definition from the previous step:
`a`{{execute HOST1}}

Let us verify the Ansible installation by running the command:
`ansible --version`{{execute HOST1}}

The output should look similar to:
<pre>
ansible 2.3.0.0
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
  python version = 2.7.6 (default, Oct 26 2016, 20:30:19) [GCC 4.8.4]
</pre>

# Check Local Execution

We now can "ping" our local machine:
`ansible all -i 'localhost,' -c local -m ping`{{execute HOST1}}

> Note that an ansible ping is not an ICMP request, as you might expect. Instead, it is a test of the SSH connection. However, we have used an Ansible command with `-c local` option. This option tells Ansible to bypass the network, so the Ansible client can execute local commands without the need of any connection.

# Check Remote Connections
The same Ansible ping will fail, if run it without the `-c local` flag:

`ansible all -i 'localhost,' -m ping`{{execute HOST1}}

This will lead to following error:

<pre style="color: red"> localhost | UNREACHABLE! => {
    "changed": false,
    "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: ssh: connect to host localhost port 22: Connection refused\r\n",
    "unreachable": true
}
</pre>

The same will occur, when wir specify our remote target instead of 'localhost':

`ansible all -i 'target,' -m ping`{{execute HOST1}}

We will resolve this issue during the next steps.
# Next Step: Prepare Remote Target

Let us exit from the ansible container 

`exit`{{execute HOST1}}

and enter the target container:

`t`{{execute HOST1}} 

In our case, the target is an Ubuntu machine with no SSH server installed. Let us do that now:

`apt-get update; apt-get install -y openssh-server;service ssh start`{{execute HOST1}}

# Goto 3

obsolete:
# Next Step: Create SSH Key on Ansible Container

In order to be able to connect from the Ansible container to the target container, we need to create a private + public SSH key pair on Ansible and copy the public key to the target machine.

For that, let us exit from the target container 

`exit`{{execute HOST1}}

and enter the ansible container again.

`a`{{execute HOST1}} 

On the ansible system, let us generate a SSH key pair like follows: 
`ssh-keygen -t rsa`{{execute HOST1}} 

Just keep the defaults, click into the black terminal space and press return three times.

This will generate ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and ~/.ssh/id_rsa on the ~/.ssh directory:

`ls -ltr ~/.ssh`{{execute HOST1}} 

Let us copy the public key to a shared folder, we have prepared beforehand.

`cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub /shared_volume/ansible_id_rsa.pub`{{execute HOST1}}

Now we need to connect to our target again:

`exit`{{execute HOST1}}


`t`{{execute HOST1}}

# Append public key to target's authorized_keys file

The public SSH key of ansible needs to be appended to the list of authorized_keys:

```[ ! -d ~/.ssh ] && mkdir ~/.ssh;
cat /shared_volume/ansible_id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
```{{execute HOST1}}

# Next Step: Connect to remote Target

Now is the time to re-run the Ansible ping to the target. For that, we log in to the ansible container again:

`exit`{{execute HOST1}}


`a`{{execute HOST1}}


Now we test the connection, that had failed previously:

`ansible all -i 'target,' -m ping`{{execute HOST1}}

This time we get following output, if we confirm the fingerprint with a `yes`{{execute HOST1}}:
<pre>
The authenticity of host 'target (172.19.0.3)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is 6e:f4:bb:e2:40:b8:1b:bc:fc:96:61:d3:50:59:12:e7.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"

> 3. copying the public key to the target system

Now open a new terminal by clicking on the + sign right of the Terminal tab (otherwise, the next command will not work).

In the second terminal, we run a separate Docker container. This will be our target system.

`cd shared_volume; docker run -it --name target --rm --network mynetwork -v $(pwd):/shared_volume ubuntu:14.04 bash`{{execute HOST2}}

On the target system, we install and start a SSH Server:

`apt-get update; apt-get install -y openssh-server;service ssh start`{{execute HOST2}}

On the ansible system Terminal 1), let us generate a SSH key pair like follows:
`ssh-keygen -t rsa`{{execute HOST1}} 

Just keep the defaults and press return three times.


Now we will add the public key of the ansible host to the list of authorized keys of the target host. For that, we make use of a shared_volume between Docker host and the two Docker containers:

`cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub /shared_volume/ansible_id_rsa.pub`{{execute HOST1}}

The public SSH key needs to be appended to the list of ansible's

`mkdir ~/.ssh; cat /shared_volume/ansible_id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`{{execute HOST2}}

Now let us try to connect to localhost via SSH using Ansible:
`ansible all -i 'target,' -m ping`{{execute HOST1}}

This time you should see:

<span style="color: green">
```
target | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```
</span>
it should work.


# Try to connect to localhost via SSH using Ansible

Now try the same Ansible ping without `-c local` option, forcing Ansible to connect via SSH.

Let us check the status of the SSH service first:
`service ssh status`{{execute HOST1}}

If it is not up and running, let us install and start an SSH server:
`apt-get update; apt-get install -y openssh-server;service ssh start`{{execute HOST1}}

`service ssh status`{{execute HOST1}}

Now we try to connect to localhost using ansible
`ansible all -i 'localhost,' -m ping`{{execute HOST1}}

Accept the fingerprint by typing `yes`{{execute HOST1}}.

We get an error message: <span style="color:red">Permission denied (publickey,password).</span>

The reason gets clearer, when we try to ssh to the localhost:

`ssh localhost`{{execute HOST1}}

The system is asking for a root password. Instead of allowing users to log in with username and password, we will create and deploy a SSH key pair to source and target in the next step.

# Prepare the SSH key and try again to connect to localhost via SSH using Ansible

Let us generate a SSH key pair like follows:
`ssh-keygen -t rsa`{{execute HOST1}} 

Now we will add the public key to the list of authorized keys of the ansible host:

`cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`{{execute HOST1}}

Let us try again to connect to localhost via SSH using Ansible:
`ansible all -i 'localhost,' -m ping`{{execute HOST1}}

This time it should work.

# Retry connecting to localhost via SSH using Ansible


Now open a new terminal by clicking on the + sign right of the Terminal tab (otherwise, the next command will not work).

In the second terminal, we run a separate Docker container. This will be our target system.

`cd shared_volume && docker run -it --name target --rm  --link ansible -v $(pwd):/shared_volume ubuntu:14.04 bash`{{execute HOST2}}

On the target system, we install and start a SSH Server:

`apt-get update; apt-get install -y openssh-server;service ssh start`{{execute HOST2}}

On the ansible system, let us generate a SSH key pair like follows:
`ssh-keygen -t rsa`{{execute HOST1}} 

Just keep the defaults and press return three times.


Now we will add the public key of the ansible host to the list of authorized keys of the target host. For that, we make use of a shared_volume between Docker host and the two Docker containers:

`cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub /shared_volume/ansible_id_rsa.pub`{{execute HOST1}}

The public SSH key needs to be appended to the list of ansible's

`mkdir ~/.ssh; cat /shared_volume/ansible_id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`{{execute HOST2}}

Now let us try to connect to localhost via SSH using Ansible:
`ansible all -i 'target,' -m ping`{{execute HOST1}}

This time it should work.


# Prepare for easier toggling between hosts

Now let us define the commands "a" and "t" for quickly connecting to the ansible and target container:

Connect to the Ansible container:

```
a() { 
    docker exec -it ansible bash -c "echo 'PS1='\''ansible# '\' >> /root/.bashrc; bash"; 
}
```{{execute HOST1}}

Connect to the Target container:

```
t() { 
    docker exec -it target bash -c "echo 'PS1='\''target# '\' >> /root/.bashrc; bash"; 
}
```{{execute HOST1}}

We already have started an ansible and a target container in the background. However, it sometimes takes some time to be available. Use a docker ps command to check, whether Docker containers named 'ansible' and 'target' have been started already:

`docker ps`{{execute HOST1}}

As soon as the containers are available, we should be able to connect to the Ansible container:
`a`{{execute HOST1}}

# 3. Prepare Remote Target: Install SSH

Let us exit from the ansible container 

`exit`{{execute HOST1}}

and enter the target container:

`t`{{execute HOST1}} 

In our case, the target is an Ubuntu machine with no SSH server installed. Let us do that now:

`apt-get update; apt-get install -y openssh-server;service ssh start`{{execute HOST1}}

# 4. Prepare Remote Connection: Create SSH Key on Ansible Host

In order to be able to connect from the Ansible container to the target container, we need to create a private + public SSH key pair on Ansible and copy the public key to the target machine.

For that, let us exit from the target container 

`exit`{{execute HOST1}}

and enter the ansible container again.

`a`{{execute HOST1}} 

On the ansible system, let us generate a SSH key pair like follows: 
`ssh-keygen -t rsa`{{execute HOST1}} 

Just keep the defaults and press return three times.

This will generate ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and ~/.ssh/id_rsa on the ~/.ssh directory:

`ls -ltr ~/.ssh`{{execute HOST1}} 

# 5. Prepare Remote Connection: Transfer SSH public Key to Target

Let us copy the public key to a shared folder, we have prepared beforehand.

`cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub /shared_volume/ansible_id_rsa.pub`{{execute HOST1}}

> In situations, where no shared_volume is available, it is sufficient to copy the content of the file to the clipboard, so we can paste it to the appropriate file on the target.

# Append public key to target's authorized_keys file

In order to inform the target about the ansible host's public SSH key, we need to connect to the target again:

`exit`{{execute HOST1}}


`t`{{execute HOST1}}

The public SSH key of ansible needs to be appended to the list of authorized_keys:

`[ ! -d ~/.ssh ] && mkdir ~/.ssh; cat /shared_volume/ansible_id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`{{execute HOST1}}

Let us review the resulting file:

`cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`{{execute HOST1}}

It should contain a line similar to following:

<pre>
BLA
</pre>


# 6. Connect from Ansible host to Target

Now, since the target knows about the Ansible host's public SSH key, we are ready to connect from the Ansible host to our target:

`exit`{{execute HOST1}}


`a`{{execute HOST1}}


Now we test the connection, that had failed previously:

`ansible all -i 'target,' -m ping`{{execute HOST1}}

This time we get following output, if we confirm the fingerprint with a `yes`{{execute HOST1}}:
<pre>
The authenticity of host 'target (172.19.0.3)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is 6e:f4:bb:e2:40:b8:1b:bc:fc:96:61:d3:50:59:12:e7.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
<span style="color: green">target | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}</span>
</pre>

Success!

# Finish

# Summary

Let us summarize, what we have achieved so far:
> We have prepared the successful connection from an Ansible system to a target system by
> 1. installing an ssh server on the target
> 2. creating an SSH key pair on the Ansible system
> 3. copying the public key to the target system
